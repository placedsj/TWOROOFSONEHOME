## 2026-02-16 - Keyboard Navigation in Document Viewers
**Learning:** Document-heavy interfaces like `DigitalBinder` significantly benefit from keyboard navigation (Arrow keys for paging, Escape for closing). This mimics native reader behavior and is a "delight" feature for power users.
**Action:** Always check if paginated content or modal dialogs can be controlled via keyboard shortcuts, and ensure visual focus or scroll position resets accordingly.
